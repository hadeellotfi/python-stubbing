# Stubs
# These are objects that provide a canned response to a method or function call. 
# In Python, we can use the unittest.mock library to create a stub.

from unittest.mock import MagicMock

# Create a stub object
my_stub = MagicMock(return_value=42)

# Call the stub object
result = my_stub()

# Assert that the result is equal to 42
assert result == 42 

"""
Stubs can be used to provide a canned response to a method or function call.
 For example, suppose we have a function that performs some complex calculation
   and returns the result:

"""
def complex_calculation(x, y):
    # Perform some complex calculation
    return x * y + x - y

# To test this function, we could create a stub object that provides a predetermined result:

from unittest.mock import MagicMock

def test_complex_calculation():
    # Create a stub object for the function
    complex_calculation = MagicMock(return_value=42)
    
    # Call the function being tested
    result = complex_calculation(2, 3)
    
    # Assert that the result is equal to the expected value
    assert result == 42
